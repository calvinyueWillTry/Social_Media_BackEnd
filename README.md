Social Network API using NoSQL

## Overview of routes
It starts with the Models folder, User, Thought and Reaction. User contain both the Thought and User arrays as options in its model, although only the username and email are required. 
In the Thought model, the Reaction array is also included as an option in the model, although only the username and thoughtText are required. From there, Both the User and Thought models are routed in their index, given the url ID of "/users" and "/thoughts" respectively.
At the same time, the Thought and User models are being exported to the controller folder. Here, the functions and their coding to enable these routes to perform different functions, which are all contained within module.exports={}; so that these can be exported.
In the meantime, the variable "router" is used to send all of these to the index folder in the routes folder. With "/api" path preceding, This allows access to the userRoutes and thoughtRoutes files, with each route given a string name to be used in the URL.   
These are finally all sent to the server (root level index) file, to allow it to have a url to even be utilized.

## Models folder
Within the models, there are minimal requirements to fulfill the criteria for inputting all CRUD routes. User requires username and email, Thought requires username and thoughtText (which User put out that thought), and Reaction only requires the thoughtId in the URL, followed by "/reactions" with the reactionBody (reaction text to the thought posted) and username (who wrote it) in the req.body.

## Controllers


## Getting Started

Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine. Follow the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB locally.

Use the following guidelines to set up your models and API routes:

### Models

**User**:

* `username`
  * String
  * Unique
  * Required
  * Trimmed

* `email`
  * String
  * Required
  * Unique
  * Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)

* `thoughts`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `Thought` model

* `friends`
  * Array of `_id` values referencing the `User` model (self-reference)

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `friendCount` that retrieves the length of the user's `friends` array field on query.

---

**Thought**:

* `thoughtText`
  * String
  * Required
  * Must be between 1 and 280 characters

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

* `username` (The user that created this thought)
  * String
  * Required

* `reactions` (These are like replies)
  * Array of nested documents created with the `reactionSchema`

**Schema Settings**:

Create a virtual called `reactionCount` that retrieves the length of the thought's `reactions` array field on query.

---

**Reaction** (SCHEMA ONLY)

* `reactionId`
  * Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
  * Default value is set to a new ObjectId

* `reactionBody`
  * String
  * Required
  * 280 character maximum

* `username`
  * String
  * Required

* `createdAt`
  * Date
  * Set default value to the current timestamp
  * Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query

**Schema Settings**:

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the `Thought` model.

### API Routes

**`/api/users`**

* `GET` all users

* `GET` a single user by its `_id` and populated thought and friend data

* `POST` a new user:

```json
// example data
{
  "username": "lernantino",
  "email": "lernantino@gmail.com"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a user by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove user by its `_id`

**BONUS**: Remove a user's associated thoughts when deleted.

---

**`/api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId`**

* `POST` to add a new friend to a user's friend list

* `DELETE` to remove a friend from a user's friend list

---

**`/api/thoughts`**

* `GET` to get all thoughts

* `GET` to get a single thought by its `_id`

* `POST` to create a new thought (don't forget to push the created thought's `_id` to the associated user's `thoughts` array field)

```json
// example data
{
  "thoughtText": "Here's a cool thought...",
  "username": "lernantino",
  "userId": "5edff358a0fcb779aa7b118b"
}
```

* `PUT` to update a thought by its `_id`

* `DELETE` to remove a thought by its `_id`

---

**`/api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions`**

* `POST` to create a reaction stored in a single thought's `reactions` array field

* `DELETE` to pull and remove a reaction by the reaction's `reactionId` value

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Deliverables: 10%

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 37%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the social media API must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

  * The walkthrough video must show all of the technical acceptance criteria being met.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate how to start the application’s server.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for all users and all thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate GET routes for a single user and a single thought being tested in Insomnia.

  * The walkthrough video must demonstrate POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for users and thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

  * Walkthrough video must demonstrate POST and DELETE routes for a user’s friend list being tested in Insomnia.

  * Walkthrough video must demonstrate POST and DELETE routes for reactions to thoughts being tested in Insomnia.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Uses the [Mongoose package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) to connect to a MongoDB database.

  * Includes User and Thought models outlined in the Challenge instructions.

  * Includes schema settings for User and Thought models as outlined in the Challenge instructions.

  * Includes Reactions as the `reaction` field's subdocument schema in the Thought model.

  * Uses functionality to format queried timestamps properly.

### Repository Quality: 13%

* Repository has a unique name.

* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* Repository contains a high-quality README with description and a link to a walkthrough video.

### Bonus: +10 Points

Fulfilling the following can add up to 10 points to your grade. Note that the highest grade you can achieve is still 100:

* Application deletes a user's associated thoughts when the user is deleted.

## Review

You are required to submit BOTH of the following for review:

* A walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application and all of the acceptance criteria being met.

* The URL of the GitHub repository. Give the repository a unique name and include a README describing the project.
